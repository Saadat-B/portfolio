              building things that work as great as they look. Whether itâ€™s a

              With 3+ years of experience working with both startups and
              established teams, Iâ€™ve crafted everything from lightning-fast
              dashboards to scalable backend systems. I mostly vibe with React,
              Next.js, Node.js, Express, Prisma, and PostgreSQL â€” the kind of
              stack that helps me build smooth, performant, and maintainable
              products. Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into Go, web3, CLI
              tools, and blockchain development to level up my backend game and
              contribute to more advanced, distributed systems.

              Outside of code, Iâ€™m often exploring open source, tinkering with
              new tech, or planning my next adventure outdoors. Iâ€™m always up
              for a good challenge and excited about working on real-world
              problems with real impact.
